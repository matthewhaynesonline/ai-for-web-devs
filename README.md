# AI and ML for Web Devs

This is the code that accompanies the [AI and ML for Web Devs video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwPYSl1MQp4FpIzn48ypesKYzLvUBQpPF&si=CvOWb9LmPnWxgJnn).

### Goals

1. **Teach AI and ML Concepts by Building**

   - We'll focus on generative AI and machine learning.
   - While many frameworks and libraries already offer the functionalities we'll build, our goal is to understand the underlying mechanics and ideas through hands-on projects.

2. **Provide Practical Implementations**
   - The code here is intended to be functional and educational but not necessarily production-ready or reference implementations.

### Target Audience

1. **Web Developers**
   - This guide is tailored for web developers who want to learn AI and ML in a practical, hands-on way.
   - While we will cover essential theories and concepts, the focus is on practical application rather than academic or research-level depth.
